Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.


Import & Visualize the Data
- Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude,
- Your data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color,
- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked,
- Created a legend that will provide context for your map data,
- Visualization the map.
